# EPS Scheduling — Frontend Prototype

This is a minimal frontend prototype for the EPS Scheduling System. It implements an Orders CRUD UI backed by a localStorage mock API.

Steps to run (Windows PowerShell):

1. Open a PowerShell terminal in `c:\prototype\frontend`
2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Start the dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

4. Open the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

Notes:
- Data is stored in your browser's localStorage. Use the "Bootstrap Sample" button in Orders to populate demo data.
- This is a frontend-only prototype; backend APIs are mocked locally.
